# Light Worktrees (`lwt`)

Git worktrees are powerful, but the default workflow is awkward: too many commands to create one, too little visibility into what is safe to delete, and too much friction when you just want to jump into parallel work.

`lwt` makes worktrees feel like they should have felt all along: fast to create, easy to switch, and safe to clean up. It also bakes in the workflows that matter in practice, like opening your editor, booting a dev server, or handing a fresh worktree straight to Claude, Codex, or Gemini.

Create a worktree in one command. Remove it with a safety summary that shows merge state, dirty files, and unpushed commits before anything destructive happens.

## Why `lwt`

- Create a new worktree or adopt an existing branch in one command
- Jump between worktrees with fuzzy search instead of memorizing paths
- Remove worktrees with a clear safety check before anything gets deleted
- Launch editors, dev servers, and AI agents as part of the same flow
- Keep worktrees organized under a predictable `../.worktrees/<project>/<branch>` layout

## Install

Requires `zsh`, `git`, and `fzf`. You'll also want [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) for full functionality (see [Requirements](#requirements)).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/linuz90/lwt.git ~/Code/lwt
echo 'source ~/Code/lwt/lwt.sh' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Verify everything is set up:

```bash
lwt doctor
```

Implementation note: `lwt.sh` remains the only entrypoint you source. It loads the implementation from `lib/*.sh` internally.

## Usage

```bash
lwt add (a)        [branch] [-s] [-e] [-yolo]
                   [--agents claude,codex[,gemini] [prompt]]
                   [--claude|--codex|--gemini [prompt]]
                   [--<agent-combo> [prompt]]
                   [--split "cmd"] [--tab "cmd"] [--split-dev]
                   [--split-claude|--split-codex|--split-gemini [prompt]]
lwt checkout (co)  [query] [-e]
lwt switch (s)     [query] [-e]
lwt list (ls)
lwt remove (rm)    [query]
lwt clean          [-n]
lwt rename (rn)    <new-name>
lwt doctor
lwt help           [command]
```

`--<agent-combo>` means any hyphenated mix of supported agents, for example `--claude-codex`, `--codex-gemini`, or `--claude-codex-gemini`.

Examples:

| `lwt rn new-api-name`                                | Rename the current worktree and branch together                     |

## Remote-Aware Status

`lwt` fetches from remotes before showing status, so what you see is always current:

- **merged** — branch is merged (including squash-merge detection via `gh`)
- **dirty** — uncommitted changes in the worktree
- **unpushed** — local commits not yet on the remote
- **behind** — remote has commits you haven't pulled

This matters most during `remove` — you'll see exactly what you'd lose before confirming.

## AI Agent Launch

Spin up a worktree and immediately hand it off to an AI coding agent:

```bash
lwt a feat-api --claude "add retries to webhook sender"
lwt a feat-api --codex "implement OAuth callback handling"
lwt a feat-ui --gemini "refactor profile page layout"
```

The worktree is created, your shell `cd`s into it, and the agent starts working in an isolated checkout that cannot interfere with your main repository state.

Single-agent flags are shorthand for `--agents` with one item, so `--claude`, `--codex`, and `--gemini` still work exactly as before. The prompt is optional. Passing one of those flags by itself launches that agent interactively in the new worktree.

For multiple agents with the same prompt, use `--agents` or a hyphen alias:

```bash
lwt a feat-auth --agents claude,codex "implement refresh token rotation"
lwt a feat-auth --claude-codex "implement refresh token rotation"
lwt a feat-auth --codex-gemini "compare two refactor approaches"
```

This is best when you want multiple independent takes on the same prompt: reviews, plans, audits, debugging hypotheses, or implementation attempts.

When more than one runnable agent is requested, `lwt` uses the current shell for the first agent and opens one split per remaining agent when terminal automation is available. If split automation is unavailable, `lwt` still launches the first runnable agent and prints manual launch commands for the rest.

If you want different agents doing different jobs, use explicit split-agent flags instead:

```bash
lwt a feat-auth --claude "implement refresh token rotation" --split-codex "investigate edge cases in the current auth flow and suggest tests"
```

By default, agents launch in interactive mode. Pass `-yolo` to auto-approve all agent actions for that run, or set it globally:

```bash
git config --global lwt.agent-mode yolo
```

Split-agent flags follow the same agent behavior, but launch in a new split instead of the current shell:

```bash
lwt a feat-api --split-claude "review the auth flow"
lwt a feat-api --split-codex "investigate flaky tests"
lwt a feat-api --split-gemini "compare these approaches"
```

These differ from `--claude`, `--codex`, and `--gemini` in one important way:

- `--claude` / `--codex` / `--gemini` launch the agent in your current shell after `cd`-ing into the new worktree
- `--agents claude,codex` and hyphen aliases like `--claude-codex` launch the first agent in your current shell and the rest in splits when supported
- `--split-claude` / `--split-codex` / `--split-gemini` launch a second agent session in a new split, leaving your current shell free

## Terminal Automation

`lwt add` can also open the sessions you usually need right after the worktree is ready:

```bash
lwt a feat-api --split "pnpm test --watch"
lwt a feat-api --tab "pnpm lint --watch"
lwt a feat-api --codex "fix auth" --split-dev
lwt a feat-auth --agents claude,codex "fix auth edge cases"
```

What each flag does:

- `--split "cmd"` runs any command in a new terminal split inside the new worktree
- `--tab "cmd"` runs any command in a new terminal tab inside the new worktree
- `--split-dev` resolves the repo's dev command and runs it in a split
- `--agents claude,codex` launches the first agent in your current shell and opens splits for the rest when more than one agent is requested
- `--split-claude [prompt]` launches Claude in a split, optionally with an initial prompt
- `--split-codex [prompt]` launches Codex in a split, optionally with an initial prompt
- `--split-gemini [prompt]` launches Gemini in a split, optionally with an initial prompt

You can combine multiple session flags in one command if you want the worktree, app, tests, and agents to come up together.

Recommended workflows:

```bash
# You code in the current shell, app boots in a split
lwt a feat-checkout --split-dev

# Codex works in the current shell, dev server runs beside it
lwt a feat-billing --codex "fix invoice retry handling" --split-dev

# Claude runs in the current shell, Codex opens beside it
lwt a feat-auth --agents claude,codex "implement refresh token rotation"

# One extra split for tests, one extra tab for linting
lwt a feat-search --split "pnpm test --watch" --tab "pnpm lint --watch"

# Use a second agent to investigate in parallel while the first one builds
lwt a feat-auth --claude "implement refresh token rotation" --split-codex "investigate edge cases in the current auth flow and suggest tests"
```

Today this supports Ghostty and iTerm2 on macOS. `lwt` auto-detects the current terminal from `TERM_PROGRAM`, or you can pin one explicitly:

```bash
git config --global lwt.terminal ghostty
```

Use `lwt doctor` to confirm whether terminal automation is available and which driver was detected.

## Dependency Setup

New worktrees don't share `node_modules` with your main checkout. Pass `-s`/`--setup` to auto-install dependencies after creating a worktree:

```bash
lwt a feat-api -s                # create worktree + install deps
```

`lwt` detects your package manager from the lockfile — pnpm, bun, yarn, or npm.

When using an agent flag (`--agents`, `--claude`, `--codex`, `--gemini`, `--split-claude`, `--split-codex`, `--split-gemini`), dependencies are always installed automatically since agents need a working environment.

`--split-dev` also forces setup before launching the dev command in a split. The dev command resolves in this order:

1. `git config lwt.dev-cmd`
2. Root `package.json` `scripts.dev`, run with the detected package manager

For monorepos or custom workflows, set it explicitly:

```bash
git config --global lwt.dev-cmd "pnpm --filter web dev"
```

## Worktree Layout

`lwt add` creates worktrees in:

```text
../.worktrees/<project>/<branch>
```

This keeps your project root and sibling repos clean while making worktrees easy to find and bulk-manage.

## Safe Removal

`lwt remove` never silently deletes work:

- Shows a safety summary first (merge status, dirty state, push state)
- Uses `git worktree remove` as the primary path
- Only forces removal after explicit confirmation
- Offers local and remote branch cleanup after removal

## Bulk Cleanup

`lwt clean` finds all merged worktrees and removes them in one go — worktrees, local branches, and remote branches. Uses the same merge detection as `lwt list` (including squash-merge via `gh`).

Use `lwt clean -n` to preview what would be removed without deleting anything.

## Rename

`lwt rename <new-name>` renames a worktree's branch and moves its directory to match — atomically. If called from inside a linked worktree, it renames that one. Otherwise an fzf picker is shown.

If the branch has been pushed, you'll be prompted to rename the remote branch too. When `gh` is available, open PRs are automatically recreated on the new branch (the old PR is closed with a cross-reference). If an AI agent is running in the worktree, you'll be warned that it will need to be restarted after the rename.

## Editor Integration

Pass `-e` to open the worktree in your editor after creating or switching.

Resolution order:

1. `--editor-cmd "..."` (per command)
2. `git config lwt.editor`
3. `LWT_EDITOR`
4. `VISUAL`
5. `EDITOR`

Recommended setup:

```bash
git config --global lwt.editor zed
```

## Requirements

Required: `git`, `fzf`, `zsh`

Strongly recommended:

- `gh` — used by `list`, `remove`, `clean`, and `rename`. Enables squash-merge detection so merged worktrees are correctly identified, and recreates open PRs when renaming branches. Without `gh`, these features degrade gracefully but you lose visibility and risk orphaned PRs.

Optional:

- `claude`, `codex`, `gemini` CLIs — for agent launch
- macOS + `osascript` + Ghostty or iTerm2 — for split/tab automation
